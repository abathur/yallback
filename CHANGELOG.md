# Changelog

## May 25, 2021
Initially, yallback supported a single argument (the callback script). Now, additional arguments are accepted and passed to the source builtin.

You can use this to pass in information to adjust how your sourced script sets itself up, or even to pass it the name(s) of additional plugin scripts for it (i.e., your yallback script) to source.
