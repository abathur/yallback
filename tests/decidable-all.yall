# - `yallback:rule:<rulename>:all` - receive all rule matches in a single call
#     - `$1` == `<rulename>` (this is a convenience, in case you want a single function to handle multiple rules)
#     - matching files are passed on stdin, one per line

# Note: used to be `alias yallback:rule:decidable:all=true`,
#       but I see pipe errors on linux... fixable?
